# Sparkrock Assignment – Provision, Deploy, and Monitor

A complete reference implementation for **Assignment #2** (AWS path). It provisions a minimal staging environment, deploys a Dockerized Node.js API and a static front‑end, protects the app with **HTTP Basic Auth**, enables a **CPU > 70%** CloudWatch alarm, and sets up **CI/CD** with GitHub Actions.

---

## 🎯 **Solution Overview**

### **What This Project Does**
This is a **complete DevOps solution** that demonstrates how to:
- **Automate infrastructure** using Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- **Deploy applications** automatically via CI/CD pipelines
- **Secure applications** with HTTPS and authentication
- **Monitor systems** with AWS CloudWatch and alerts
- **Manage containers** using Docker and ECR

### **How It Solves the Assignment Requirements**

#### ✅ **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**
- **VPC & Networking**: Creates a complete network infrastructure with public subnets
- **Compute Resources**: Provisions EC2 instances with proper IAM roles and security groups
- **Container Registry**: Sets up ECR repositories for Docker images
- **Monitoring**: Configures CloudWatch alarms and SNS notifications
- **Security**: Implements security groups, IAM policies, and access controls

#### ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**
- **Automated Builds**: Builds Docker images on every code push
- **Container Registry**: Pushes images to AWS ECR automatically
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: Uses AWS SSM to deploy without SSH access
- **Configuration Management**: Updates authentication and environment settings
- **Rollback Capability**: Can easily revert to previous versions

#### ✅ **Application Deployment**
- **Containerized Architecture**: Both frontend and backend run in Docker containers
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx handles HTTPS termination and load balancing
- **Security**: HTTP Basic Auth protects all endpoints
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Self-signed certificates for staging (production-ready with ACM)

#### ✅ **Monitoring & Observability**
- **Real-time Monitoring**: CloudWatch tracks CPU, memory, and application metrics
- **Alerting**: SNS notifications for critical thresholds (>70% CPU)
- **Health Checks**: Application endpoints provide status information
- **Logging**: Centralized logging for troubleshooting and debugging

## 🚀 Quick Start - Get Running in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Prerequisites Setup
- **AWS Account**: Create and verify an AWS account
- **IAM User**: Create IAM user with these permissions:
  - VPC, EC2, IAM, ECR, CloudWatch, SNS
- **Access Keys**: Generate and secure access keys
- **Local Tools**: Install Terraform >= 1.5.0 and AWS CLI

### Step 2: GitHub Repository Setup
1. **Push this code** to a GitHub repository
2. **Set default branch** to `main`
3. **Configure Repository Secrets**:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Your AWS access key
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Your AWS secret key
   - `BASIC_AUTH_USER` - Username for app access
   - `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` - Password for app access
4. **Optional**: Set repository variable `AWS_REGION` (default: eu-central-1)

### Step 3: Deploy and Run
```bash
# 1. Deploy Infrastructure
cd infrastructure
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve -var="alert_email=your@email.com"

# 2. Note the outputs:
# - instance_public_ip
# - application_http_url (port 8080 - main app)
# - application_direct_url (port 80)
# - ecr_api_repo_url
# - ecr_web_repo_url

# 3. Test the infrastructure (NO SSL needed!)
# Open: http://<instance-ip>:8080 (should show nginx working)
# Open: http://<instance-ip>:80 (direct access)
# Open: http://<instance-ip>:3000 (API health check)

# 4. Confirm SNS email subscription (check your email)

# 5. Push to GitHub main branch (triggers CI/CD)
git add .
git commit -m "Initial deployment"
git push origin main

# 6. Access your application
# Main app: http://<instance-ip>:8080
# API health: http://<instance-ip>:3000/api/health
```

### 🧪 **Testing Your Deployment**
After `terraform apply` completes, test these URLs in your browser:

1. **`http://<instance-ip>:8080`** - Main application (nginx reverse proxy)
2. **`http://<instance-ip>:80`** - Direct web service  
3. **`http://<instance-ip>:3000/api/health`** - API health check

**If these work, your infrastructure is running correctly!** 🎉

## 📋 What Happens Automatically

### Infrastructure (Terraform)
- ✅ VPC with 2 public subnets across AZs
- ✅ EC2 instance (t3.micro) with proper IAM roles
- ✅ ECR repositories for API and web images
- ✅ Security groups (HTTPS 443, HTTP 80 redirect)
- ✅ CloudWatch CPU monitoring (>70% threshold)
- ✅ SNS email alerts

### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Builds Docker images on push to main
- ✅ Pushes images to ECR
- ✅ Deploys via AWS SSM (no SSH needed)
- ✅ Updates Basic Auth credentials
- ✅ Restarts application containers

### Application
- ✅ Node.js backend API (port 3000)
- ✅ Static frontend served via Nginx
- ✅ Reverse proxy with HTTPS and Basic Auth
- ✅ Self-signed certificates (staging appropriate)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Common Issues
- **Terraform fails**: Check AWS credentials and permissions
- **CI/CD fails**: Verify GitHub secrets are set correctly
- **App not accessible**: Check security groups allow port 443
- **Basic Auth not working**: Verify GitHub secrets are set

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Check infrastructure status
terraform show

# Check application health
curl -k https://<instance-ip>/api/health

# View container logs
docker logs <container_name>

# Restart services
docker compose restart
```

---

## 🧹 Clean Up
```bash
cd infrastructure
terraform destroy
```

---

## 📁 Project Structure
```
/infrastructure     # Terraform: VPC, EC2, IAM, ECR, CloudWatch
/cicd/github-actions/deploy.yml  # Build & deploy on push to main
/app/backend        # Node.js API (Dockerized)
/app/frontend       # Static front-end (Dockerized via nginx)
```
